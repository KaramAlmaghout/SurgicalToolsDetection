# SurgicalToolsDetection


AML Course - Course Project


## Introduction

In this project, we aim to train YOLOv8 model to detect surgical tools, which can be further used to detect and track these tools during operations. 

Applications of this project:

  1. Robotizing surgical operation.
  2. Tracking tools during tele surgical operations.
  3. Tracking tools for mentoring and assessment purposes.

## Dataset: 

[m2cai16-tool-locations](http://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/resources/m2cai16-tool-locations.zip)

The m2cai16-tool-locations dataset has 2,532 frames from the first 10 out of 15 videos in the m2cai16-tool dataset. The dataset has 7 different types of surgical instruments.
